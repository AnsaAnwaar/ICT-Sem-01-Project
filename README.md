# ICT-Sem-01-Project
Welcome to DIYA, your place for beautiful wedding dresses. This website is the project of my first semester it comprises of only frontend. Our website has a lovely collection of dresses for modern brides. Each dress has its own love and grace.
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we've made this website where brides can easily find their dream dress. Come to DIYA and start your journey to your wedding day with us.

**NOTE: **
But some JavaScript files are absent because this is an older project and my current device doesn't have them. I've also created a video presentation with my teammate Nisha Pervez, which includes explanations, code walkthroughs, and demonstrations of the web pages. This video provides additional context and will help alot 
You can go through the video in this repository.
